utopian_potential,t2_52uocd67,"&gt;I know 2 months is a long time on RedditCongress was probably still looking at him but that still gives NO reason to buy a quater of his total shares at $150. He doubled down at 40. if he had just held all would be fine. But he increased his positions and 3x the price point.""so many plays""you are being ridiculous. Which undermines the entire discussion and makes you seem unreasonable. There are 2. A squeeze play and a value investment.The squeeze play because of the exceptionally high SI and the value play If you believe its transformation and the market access it will get from that.&gt;when people were actually predicting days the MOASS Of course there were things people thought would trigger the catalyst of forcing shorts to cover. Except all our information is publicly available and we KNOW hedgies have people on the boards. EVERY stock market related sub has infiltrators pushing fake DD.The fact we have uncovered so many egregious law-breaking which has ALL been eventually confirmed (dark pools limiting price discovery hiding SI in married puts and shuffling around long positions FTD's on a massive scale etc) All of this we talked about months ago is now being talked about in the MSM and by the SEC.Like what about the 500000 CS puts on bloomberg? Or those million puts from brazil? THey are hiding 150000000 shares. There are only supposed to be 75mil. So you are already looking at one of the biggest short squeezes ever - becasue to my knowledge no short squeeze has ever occurred with over 100% of the float shorted.&gt;Because if it isn't that's also a signMOASS is always used because the squeeze hasn't squozen and it'll be the laragest short squeeze ever if its allowed to go through the way it should.. &amp;#x200B;&gt; Conspiracy theories alt-right trolls foreign trolls etc. Browsing the subreddit and checking post histories I've already noticed some of them leaking into your sub.Or bad actors trying to shift the narrative.Like the MSM literally called us communists for buying and holding a stock. Buying a piece of a capitalist business apparently makes us commies.&amp;#x200B;You do you this convo wont go anywhere.If you can prove that HF covered from 240% short then ill listen. That is the squeeze play.If you can illustrate why GME is not a value play then ill listen. But as a hardcore gamer im going to follow Warren Buffets advice and invest in what I understand.",t1_h84gha9,1,StockMarket
ComprehensiveChair59,t2_8v3buryv,"I know 2 months is a long time on Reddit and all but I don't think you can reliably say ""It's been 2 months Congress isn't looking at him anymore!"" lmao. Not only that but I'm pretty sure that was his last post on Reddit was it not?In any case this DFV trivia is getting off-topic. The problem with GME subreddits is hinted in your reply:&gt;No people view the squeeze play and the value play as two different things.GME is filled with so many 'plays' that it's actually hard to discredit. The sub as a whole can easily pivot between them to maintain an air of credibility amongst its userbase. It's actually a common rhetorical tactic btw to hold multiple positions simultaneously as to never be officially proven wrong. The most blantant example of this was in the early days of GME when people were actually predicting days the MOASS would happen. When it failed new predictions were made. When those failed newer vaguer predictions were made. Is the term 'MOASS' even still used? Because if it isn't that's also a sign :pBut that doesn't mean GME itself is necessarily a bad play. That's for you to ultimately decide. But what I am pointing out is that GME's userbase is attracting the attention of the types of people who benefit most from this type of rhetoric. Conspiracy theories alt-right trolls foreign trolls etc. Browsing the subreddit and checking post histories I've already noticed some of them leaking into your sub.In any case best of luck. Hope you get your lambo. Just don't fall for the trolls they'll make you miserable.",t1_h83fffu,1,StockMarket
TravelingArthur,t2_1z2njqf8,Let me get this straight you‚Äôre looking for a random GME trade that was $7 in November and only ran up because of a major short squeeze and a bunch of random redditors.

Good luck.For your sake stick to purchasing QQQ and SPY every couple weeks.,t1_hcli1tb,3,Trading

LevitatingCockroach,t2_8w71hgqd,You shouldn‚Äôt play with GME right now. It‚Äôs basically gambling. In my opinion you‚Äôd have a better luck going to an actual casino.,t1_gqzdlmh,1,stocks
LevitatingCockroach,t2_8w71hgqd,Yes you‚Äôll have to sell the puts which is why it‚Äôll sell a little less than 10$. GME options are expensive af rn so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend playing with it.,t1_gqzdptk,1,stocks
